# Overview
This project was created as part of one of our university courses. It is a simple game, played on the command line. The player owns a lemonade stand that he/she has to manage. Each day, a certain amount of customers will buy lemonade from the player. The number of customers as well as their preference for sweeter or more sour mixtures depends on the weather. The player is also able to get a forecast for next day's weather, set the lemonade mixture for the next day, and buy new supplies.
